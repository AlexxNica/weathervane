# Weathervane Issues Guidelines

## General Guidelines

The Weathervane project encourages the use of issues for bug reports, features requests, general user issues, and questions that may have applicability to more than one user.  If you are unsure whether you should open an issue, contact us in the [Weathervane room](https://gitter.im/vmware/weathervane) on Gitter.
